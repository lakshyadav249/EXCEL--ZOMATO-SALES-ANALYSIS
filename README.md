# EXCEL--ZOMATO-SALES-ANALYSIS

## Introduction :

This project is all about worldwide Zomato Market and its services availability among different countries. Zomato is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants as well as food delivery options from partner restaurants in more than 1,000 Indian cities and towns, as of 2022â€“23. Zomato rivals Swiggy in food delivery and hyperlocal space. In this Excel Project, I have used excel features to create this interactive dashboard. In this I have shown the connection of Zomato from the whole world and its overall ratings from the whole 15 countries. I have also described the number of restaurants in the countries, types of services available like has online delivery or not, will deliver it now or not and has table booking or not. Through these data I have made a beautiful interactive dashboards that consist of two pages. First one is for Cities wise distribution under Country category and the second one was about the top 3 cities, cuisines, restaurants and localities.

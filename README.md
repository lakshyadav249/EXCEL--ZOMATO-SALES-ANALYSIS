# EXCEL--ZOMATO-SALES-ANALYSIS

## Introduction :

This project is all about worldwide Zomato Market and its services availability among different countries. Zomato is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants as well as food delivery options from partner restaurants in more than 1,000 Indian cities and towns, as of 2022–23. Zomato rivals Swiggy in food delivery and hyperlocal space. In this Excel Project, I have used excel features to create this interactive dashboard. In this I have shown the connection of Zomato from the whole world and its overall ratings from the whole 15 countries. I have also described the number of restaurants in the countries, types of services available like has online delivery or not, will deliver it now or not and has table booking or not. Through these data I have made a beautiful interactive dashboards that consist of two pages. First one is for Cities wise distribution under Country category and the second one was about the top 3 cities, cuisines, restaurants and localities.

The following Questions/outcomes were available after the Porject completion :

<h3><B>Objective Questions:</B></h3>

1)What is the total no. of tables present in the data?

2)What is the total no. of attributes present in the data?

3)How many categorical columns are there in the data? [Search about categorical and continuous data, and try to answer this question]

4)The data consists of some inconsistent and missing values so ensure that the data used for further analysis is cleaned.

5)Using the LookUp functions, fill up the countries in the original data using the country code.

6)Create a table to represent the number of restaurants opened in each country.

7)Also, the management wants to look at the number of restaurants opened each year, so provide them with something here.

8)What is the total number of restaurants in India in the price range of 4? 

9)What is the average number of voters for the restaurants in each country according to the data?

10)Calculate the average rating for all the restaurants that have price_range < 4 and provide online delivery. Use only the “IF” function, Logical Operators, and Aggregation functions to solve this problem.

11)Using Conditional formatting highlight the rows of restaurants that are located in the countries or cities that you’ve suggested to the management for opening new restaurants. 

12)Create a new customized price column that consists of the abbreviation/symbol of the currency along with the Average_cost_for_two value. [Use string operations to do this task]

13)How can you create an array formula in Excel or Google Sheets to count the number of restaurants listed that do not offer online delivery, are in the lowest price range, and have an average cost for two people less than or equal to 250 Indian Rupees?



Subjective Question:

1)Suggest a few countries where the team can open newer restaurants with lesser competition. Which visualization/technique will you use here to justify the suggestions?

2)Come up with the names of States and cities in the suggested countries suitable for opening restaurants.

3)According to the countries you suggested, what is the current quality regarding ratings for restaurants that are open there?

4)Also, what is the current expenditure on food in the suggested countries, so we can keep our financial expenditure in control?

5)Come up with the names of restaurants from the recommended states that are our biggest competitors and also those that are rated in the lower brackets, i.e. 1-2 or 2-3.

6)Which cuisines should we focus on in the newer restaurants to get better feedback? Does the choice of cuisines affect the restaurant ratings?

7)According to our current data, should we go for online delivery and table booking? Does that affect the customer’s ratings?

8)Should the team keep the rate of cuisines higher? Will that affect the feedback? According to our data are the rates of cuisines and ratings, correlated?

9)What is the distribution of the number of restaurants of different price ranges in all the countries?

10)Explain your approach in brief for suggesting countries/cities in order to open new restaurants, if the objective and subjective questions would have not been given to assist you.
